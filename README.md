# UFOs

## Purpose
Javascript and HTML code were used to create a webpage with dynamic filtering functionality. Dana’s findings about UFO sightings were posted to the web using these two coding languages. Javascript was used to filter and display the data findings in a table. HTML code was used to display her article, data table, and search filters in a neat and organized fashion.

## Results
Users visiting the site can filter based on various criteria using the “filter search” section of the webpage. In this updated version of the website, there is no need for a filter button as the table will automatically filter once the user inputs the search criteria and presses the "enter" key on their keyboard. With the dynamic filtering function, users can also filter by one search criteria or by multiple  unlike the previous page which only had one filter option. Below you can see an example of the single filter and multiple filter search results.
